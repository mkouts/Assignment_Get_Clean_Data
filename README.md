The R script **run_analysis.R** is implemented to do the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

The **codeBook.md**  describes the variables.

The output independent tidy dataset is **tidy_data.txt**.
